# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Shadcn Components
**Always use the MCP server when working with shadcn components. For detailed usage rules, see `shad-cn.mdc`.**

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server on port 8080
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run build:dev` - Build in development mode
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm i` - Install dependencies

## Architecture Overview

This is a React voice messaging application built with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The app integrates with Supabase for backend services and uses shadcn/ui components.

### Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite bundler
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **Backend**: Supabase (database, auth, storage, edge functions)
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives via shadcn/ui

### Project Structure

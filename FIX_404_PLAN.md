# Plan to Fix 404 Error on Test Page

## Issue
The test page at `/test-message-upload` returns 404 even after deployment.

## Possible Causes & Solutions

### 1. Vercel Deployment Issues
**Check:** 
- Go to Vercel dashboard
- Check if the latest deployment (c13cd4e) completed successfully
- Look for any build errors

**Fix if needed:**
- Force redeploy from Vercel dashboard
- Check build logs for errors

### 2. Import/Build Issues
The test page might not be building due to missing imports or build errors.

**Quick Fix - Add to existing page:**
Instead of a separate test page, add debug functionality to an existing page like Settings.

### 3. Alternative Debug Approach

Since the debug logging is already enabled, we can test the normal message flow:

1. **Try sending a message normally** at `/microphone`
   - You should now see detailed error messages instead of "Something went wrong"
   - The error will show the actual PostgreSQL error

2. **Check browser console**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Try sending a message
   - Look for logged errors

3. **Add debug button to existing page**
   - We can add a debug section to the Settings page
   - This avoids routing issues

## Recommended Immediate Action

Let's add debug functionality to the Settings page instead:

1. Add a debug section to Settings page (only visible in production temporarily)
2. Include the same test functions from TestMessageUpload
3. This avoids the routing/404 issue entirely

## Alternative: Direct Database Testing

If UI approach fails, we can:
1. Use Supabase dashboard SQL editor with the queries from `debug_queries.sql`
2. Test the message insert directly in SQL
3. Check function existence and parameters

## Next Steps

1. First, try sending a message normally - the debug logging should show the real error
2. If that doesn't work, we'll add debug tools to the Settings page
3. Use Supabase SQL editor as backup option

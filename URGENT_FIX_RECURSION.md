# URGENT: Fix Infinite Recursion in Voice Messages

## Current Situation
The infinite recursion error is STILL occurring when sending voice messages, even after running the nuclear fix. This is blocking all message sending functionality.

## Root Cause
The recursion is likely in the SELECT policy that checks `voice_message_recipients` table, creating a circular dependency.

## Immediate Action Plan

### 1. Run Full Diagnostic (First!)
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:
Run: supabase/migrations/20250119_full_diagnostic.sql
```

This will show:
- ALL policies on both tables
- Cross-table references
- Any remaining triggers or functions

### 2. Run Ultra Nuclear Fix
```sql
-- This removes ALL complexity:
Run: supabase/migrations/20250119_ultra_nuclear_fix.sql
```

What this does:
- Drops ALL policies from both tables
- Removes ALL triggers and functions
- Creates ultra-simple policies (sender-only access)
- NO subqueries, NO joins, NO cross-table references

### 3. Test in Application
Go to: https://voice-messenger-haven.vercel.app/test-message-upload
Click: "Test 5: Complete Flow Test (Recommended)"

Expected result:
- ✅ No infinite recursion error
- ✅ Message creates successfully
- ⚠️  Recipients won't see messages yet (temporary limitation)

### 4. If Success, Restore Recipient Access
```sql
Run: supabase/migrations/20250119_gradual_restoration.sql
```

This uses a SECURITY DEFINER function to avoid direct subqueries.

## Understanding the Scripts

### Ultra Nuclear Fix
- **Most aggressive approach**: Removes everything
- **Temporary limitation**: Only senders can see their messages
- **Goal**: Prove the system works without recursion

### Gradual Restoration
- **Safe approach**: Uses functions instead of subqueries
- **Adds back**: Recipient access to messages
- **Avoids**: Direct policy cross-references

## If Ultra Nuclear Still Fails

This would mean the recursion is NOT in the policies. Check:
1. Database triggers on other tables
2. Foreign key constraints with CASCADE
3. Custom functions that might be recursive

## Success Metrics
- No "infinite recursion" errors
- Test 5 completes successfully
- Voice messages can be sent

## Security Reminder
After fixing, IMMEDIATELY:
1. Revert debug code in `logger.ts` and `error-handler.ts`
2. Delete `TestMessageUpload.tsx`
3. Push changes to production

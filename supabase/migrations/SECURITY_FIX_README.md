# Security Fix Instructions

## Overview
This set of migrations fixes critical security vulnerabilities identified in the Supabase security advisor:
- Exposed auth.users data via views
- Functions missing search_path (vulnerable to search path attacks)
- Materialized views accessible via API
- Missing security configurations

## Migration Files Created

1. **20250116_fix_exposed_auth_views.sql**
   - Removes exposed views: `phone_sync_status`, `phone_auth_status`
   - Creates secure admin-only functions to replace them
   - Adds user-specific function for checking own sync status

2. **20250116_fix_function_search_paths.sql**
   - Updates all SECURITY DEFINER functions with `SET search_path = public`
   - Fixes 14 vulnerable functions
   - **NOTE: May fail on format_phone_e164 parameter name conflict**

3. **20250116_fix_all_remaining_search_paths.sql** *(NEW - RUN THIS FIRST)*
   - Dynamically finds and fixes ALL functions missing search_path
   - Handles functions from all schemas (public, auth, storage)
   - More comprehensive than the manual fixes

4. **20250116_secure_materialized_views.sql**
   - Secures `message_delivery_stats` materialized view
   - Removes public API access
   - Creates secure wrapper functions for admin access

5. **20250116_security_cleanup_and_summary.sql**
   - Final cleanup and validation
   - Creates security audit function
   - Now shows warnings instead of errors

## How to Apply

### Recommended Order (IMPORTANT!)

Due to the issues you encountered, run the migrations in this specific order:

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /Users/timiabiola/Enlightened\ SaaS/voice-messenger-haven

# 2. First, run the comprehensive search_path fix
supabase db push --file supabase/migrations/20250116_fix_all_remaining_search_paths.sql

# 3. Then run the other migrations
supabase db push

# 4. Verify migrations were applied
supabase db diff
```

### Manual Application (if CLI fails)

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run each migration file in this order:
   - **FIRST**: `20250116_fix_all_remaining_search_paths.sql` (fixes all search_path issues)
   - Second: `20250116_fix_exposed_auth_views.sql`
   - Third: `20250116_fix_function_search_paths.sql` (skip if errors on format_phone_e164)
   - Fourth: `20250116_secure_materialized_views.sql`
   - Fifth: `20250116_security_cleanup_and_summary.sql`

## Post-Migration Steps

### 1. Update Extensions (Manual - Dashboard Required)
In Supabase Dashboard > Database > Extensions:
- Update any extensions showing as outdated to recommended versions

### 2. Verify Security Fixes
Run this query in SQL Editor to verify all fixes:
```sql
SELECT * FROM security_audit_report();
```

All checks should show "PASS" status.

### 3. Test Your Application
- Test phone sync functionality
- Test admin dashboard access
- Test voice message sending
- Verify no functionality is broken

### 4. Monitor for Issues
Check your application logs for any errors related to:
- Missing views (now replaced with functions)
- Permission denied errors (expected for non-admin users)
- Function execution failures

## What Changed

### For Admin Users
- Use `get_phone_sync_status()` instead of direct view access
- Use `get_phone_auth_status()` for auth phone monitoring
- Use `get_message_delivery_stats()` for delivery statistics

### For Regular Users
- Use `get_my_phone_sync_status()` to check own sync status
- Use `get_my_message_stats()` for personal statistics
- No direct access to system views

### For Your Application Code
If your app was querying these views directly:
- `phone_sync_status` → Call `get_phone_sync_status()` function
- `phone_auth_status` → Call `get_phone_auth_status()` function
- `message_delivery_stats` → Call `get_message_delivery_stats()` function

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails
- Check for dependent objects: `DROP ... CASCADE` may be needed
- Ensure you have proper permissions
- Run migrations one at a time to isolate issues

### Application Errors
- Update your frontend code to use functions instead of views
- Ensure admin role is properly assigned for admin features
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Security Audit Fails
If `security_audit_report()` shows failures:
- Re-run the specific migration that addresses the issue
- Check for custom functions/views not covered by migrations
- Contact support if issues persist

## Security Best Practices Going Forward

1. Always use `SET search_path = public` on SECURITY DEFINER functions
2. Never expose auth.users data in views
3. Use RLS policies on all tables
4. Regularly run security audits
5. Keep extensions updated
6. Monitor Supabase security advisories
